# Airbus Joint Inspection System

### Overview
This project was developed at **SAMM Test & Automation** as part of my Engineering Thesis at **ENSIT (Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Ingénieurs de Tunis)**. 
It focuses on **real-time visual inspection of aircraft joints for Airbus**, using **computer vision** and **industrial automation** technologies.

The goal was to design an open, flexible, and maintainable system to replace a closed and expensive Cognex camera, while maintaining industrial-grade precision.

### System Description

The system performs **automatic inspection** of Airbus joint parts to detect:

- **Holes** (using contour and circular detection)
- **Chamfers** (via angle analysis)
- **Curvatures** (based on contour geometry)
- **OCR text** (using PaddleOCR for low-contrast green-on-blue text)

It integrates:

| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Computer Vision | Python, OpenCV |
| OCR | PaddleOCR |
| Database | MySQL |
| GUI | Tkinter |
| Communication | TCP/IP with Festo CPX-E PLC |
| Hardware | FLIR industrial camera, IP Webcam |
